# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of PyBer Analysis
The purpose of this project is to analyze all the rideshare data from Pyber, a rideshare company, during January to early May of 2019. The datapoints also include driver ids, ride ids, date of ride, fare amount, city and city type. Based on this data we will aggregate and review information that will produce effective visualizations.
## Results
See below for the results of the rideshare data for the following categories: total rides,total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

Based on the information gathered from PyBer rideshare data, the city type directly correlates to the total rides, drivers, and fare. Typically, the urban city type has a larger population which would produce more rides and drivers to perform those services. Conversely, the rural city type has the least total rides and drivers and can be attributed to the total population. However, the highest average for the total amount of fare per ride and average per driver was the rural city type. Based on this data we can project that there are fewer rural rides but are more expensive vs. more frequent rides being less expensive for urban rides.

## Summary
Based on the results, there are a few recommendations for the differences between each city type for Pyber. 

1. Include additional data to examine the average fare with the average ride time. Using this information will confirm whether higher fares are related to longer rides and other variations of the data.
2. Another recommendation would be to include more data that spans across the year. Using this information can help understand the frequency of rides and seasonality of rides for different city types.
3. Lastly, the data could include riders with loyalty/rewards. This could skew the fare data since there are additional discounts considered for their rate and overall fare paid. In addition, this could also highlight the number of repeat riders and first time riders. Knowing the difference between these riders could incentive a marketing campaign to increase the number of riders based on how many times they have used the service.
